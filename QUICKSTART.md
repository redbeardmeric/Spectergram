## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is Spectergram really secure?**  
A: Yes! We use industry-standard encryption (AES-256 and RSA-2048). Messages are encrypted in your browser before transmission.

**Q: Can anyone read my messages?**  
A: No. Only people in your room with the encryption keys can read messages. The server cannot decrypt messages.

**Q: Are messages saved anywhere?**  
A: No. Messages only exist in your browser's memory while you're in the room. They're deleted when you leave.

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**  
A: No! Just enter a username (can be anything) and start chatting. No registration required.

**Q: Can I use this on my phone?**  
A: Yes! Spectergram works on all modern browsers and can be installed as a PWA on mobile devices.

**Q: Is it free?**  
A: Yes! Spectergram is completely free and open source.

**Q: How many people can join a room?**  
A: With the free tier of Azure SignalR, up to 20 people can connect simultaneously.

**Q: What happens if I refresh the page?**  
A: You'll need to rejoin the room. All previous messages will be gone (they're ephemeral).

**Q: Can I recover deleted messages?**  
A: No. This is by design. Messages are ephemeral and cannot be recovered.

**Q: Who can see my room name?**  
A: Only the server knows room names (to route messages), but the server cannot decrypt message content.
